          When someone asks me what an <br />
          entrepreneur needs to become successful,<br />
          rarely do I hear ‘the ability to separate’. <br />
          Instead, I hear qualities like tenacity,<br />
          knowledge, passion, motivation, savvy. And <br />
          a must-have good idea. <br />
          Whilst I can’t deny those qualities are <br />
          important, they aren’t nearly as effective if <br />
          you don’t know how to one thing well. And <br />
          that is to separate yourself from business <br />
          and personal. <br />
          I speak from experience. <br />
          Separation has been my downfall. When I <br />
          first quit my job and started my <br />
          now-defunct website design business, I <br />
          didn’t anticipate how crucial separation <br />
          was. I let my time become blurred between <br />
          working and playing. I took more days off <br />
          than I had worked. I let every part of my <br />
          home become a workspace. I was blurring <br />
          the lines, and my business and I were <br />
          suffering terribly from it. <br />
          Separation isn’t something many prepare <br />
          you for when becoming an entrepreneur. Or <br />
          business owner. For a lot of people, they <br />
          think it’s implied. It’s just good business <br />
          sense, right?! <br />
          And whilst they are right, it isn’t common <br />
          sense for everyone. <br />
          I’m here to ensure you don’t make the same <br />
          mistakes as me. Here explains the art of <br />
          separation every entrepreneur needs for <br />
          their business. And the perils of thinking <br />
          you don’t need to define your personal life from your professional.
